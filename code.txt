# program that fills the entire address space
# works kinda weird, but it's self-modifying code

# GROUP add 1 to write instruction
2A 00 04 # ADD instruction
A0 03 00 # value constant 1
00 00 01
A0 03 00 # value constant that's being written to by the ADD instruction
B0 00 08 # the WRITE instruction, first treated as a value, then ran
40 00 04 # the arithmetic instruction skips to here and executes this as code, sending us to the WRITE instruction
40 00 00 # after the WRITE instruction we jump here, which sends us back to the ADD instruction
